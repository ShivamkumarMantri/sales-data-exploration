Author: Shivamkumar Chandrakant Mantri
Course: B.Tech — Artificial Intelligence & Data Science
Topic: Data Analysis, EDA, Data Visualization, Python Automation
Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Git, VS Code

🧾 1. Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete End-to-End Data Exploration (EDA) pipeline on a realistic Sales Dataset.
The goal is to simulate how data analysts and data scientists handle business datasets, extract insights, and prepare data for decision-making.

This project includes:

- Generating a realistic sample sales dataset

- Cleaning, preprocessing, and exploring data

- Identifying trends, patterns, and relationships

- Visualizing KPIs and metrics

- Documenting observations in a structured report

- Automating workflows through Python scripts

- Uploading and version-controlling the project using GitHub

It serves as a strong foundation for Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, Machine Learning preprocessing, and real-world data engineering tasks.

🧱 2. Project Objectives

✔ Create a realistic synthetic sales dataset

✔ Perform full EDA using Python

✔ Understand business questions hidden in the data

✔ Visualize metrics such as:

- Monthly sales trend

- Product category performance

- Quantity vs revenue relationship

- Price distribution

✔ Handle missing values & data types

✔ Automate report generation

✔ Upload to GitHub as a clean professional project
